# Transmission Plus Gluetun stack
# This setup ensures Transmission can ONLY
# access the internet through the VPN (Gluetun).
# If Gluetun is stopped, Transmission has NO inetrnet access.
# If Gluetun is running but not connected to the VPN,
# Transmission's traffic will be routed through Gluetun,
# but may be blocked or dropped by Gluetun's firewall.
# This prevents leaks and enforces VPN-only usage.
